This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: master
revision: HEAD

And the layers found in the meta-openembedded repo. At least 'meta-oe' and 'meta-systemd' are needed. The instructions below will take care of everything automagically.

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
branch: master
revision: HEAD

==============================
           Setup
==============================

It is recommended to follow the instruction at http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom

This will set it up for the OpenEmbedded-core layout needed for this layer instead of the old OpenEmbedded-dev layout.

==============================
       Test Reports
